The default graphics shown when pawns build a roof is a generic steel corrugated roof.
As I often do tribal colonies it seems a bit off so I made this mod to give it a more realistic feel.
Default it will now show a wood-roof until the colony has researched Electricity, when the default graphics will be shown.
When the colony has researched Multianalyzer, a more plasteel-like graphic will be shown.
If you only want to use one of the textures, there are mod-options for that.

Hope someone will find it useful!
